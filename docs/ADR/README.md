# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture the *why* behind non-trivial design decisions in
`windows-zombie`. Add a new record when proposing a change that
touches one of the following:

* Service identity, ACL model, or trust boundaries.
* Audit, policy, or approval mechanics.
* The chat HTTP surface.
* Packaging or delivery channels.
* Cross-platform parity story.

## Format

Number sequentially: `0001-title.md`, `0002-title.md`, …. Use the
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) template below.

```markdown
# NNNN. Short title

* Status: proposed | accepted | superseded by NNNN
* Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What problem are we solving? Constraints, prior art.

## Decision

What we picked. Imperative voice.

## Consequences

Positive, negative, and risks. Operational impact.

## Alternatives considered

What else we looked at and why it lost.
```
